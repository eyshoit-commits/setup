# Code Coverage workflow temporarily disabled
# 
# Reason:
# - The workflow previously ran "npm test -- --coverage" and attempted to upload
#   "./coverage/lcov.info" via the Codecov action.
# - The "test" script in package.json is currently a placeholder and does not run
#   a real test framework or produce coverage output.
# - This caused the workflow to fail or to run without generating valid coverage data.
#
# Next steps to re-enable:
# 1. Configure a real test framework (e.g., Jest, Mocha) in package.json so that
#    "npm test -- --coverage" generates a coverage report at "./coverage/lcov.info"
#    or update the command and path here to match the chosen tooling.
# 2. Restore a workflow configuration similar to the one below, adjusting as needed:
#
# name: Code Coverage
# on:
#   push:
#     branches: [main, develop]
#   pull_request:
#     branches: [main]
#
# jobs:
#   coverage:
#     runs-on: ubuntu-latest
#     steps:
#       - uses: actions/checkout@v4
#       - uses: actions/setup-node@v4
#         with:
#           node-version: '20'
#       - run: npm ci
#       - run: npm test -- --coverage
#       - name: Upload Coverage
#         uses: codecov/codecov-action@v4
#         with:
#           token: ${{ secrets.CODECOV_TOKEN }}
#           files: ./coverage/lcov.info
#
# Until these steps are completed, this file remains commented out so GitHub
# Actions ignores it and does not attempt to run a broken coverage workflow.
