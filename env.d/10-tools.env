# Tool paths (auto-generated by setup script)
# DO NOT EDIT MANUALLY - This file is regenerated on each setup run

# This is a template file. The actual paths will be generated during setup.
# After running setup.sh or setup.ps1, this file will contain:
#
# export NVM_DIR="$HOME/.nvm"
# [ -s "$NVM_DIR/nvm.sh" ] && \. "$NVM_DIR/nvm.sh"
# export PATH="$HOME/miniconda3/bin:$PATH"
# export PATH="$HOME/.cargo/bin:$PATH"
